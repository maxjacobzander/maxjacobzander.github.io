So one of the coolest things about learning in a bootcamp setting is the speed at which you acquire new skills. Throughout my time at Flatiron School, as I would pair-program with my cohort-mates, I would frequently point out how cool it was that we were facing the challenges that we were at that moment (as opposed to the ones we had faced previously) because it would highlight to me the distance we had traveled in our learning. The problems we once had were no longer problems and things that we were doing with ease would have seemed impossible at one time not too long before. And as I am starting to wrap up my final project for Flatiron School, I have been spending a lot of time reflecting on the journey, and one very specific resurfaced.

When we first learned about Booleans way back when, I had a pretty big problem. And it wasn’t just me. Once I mentioned it to my cohort, it became apparent that a handful of my cohort-mates had made the exact same mistake: we had all mispronounced “Boolean.” Now, if you’re reading this, odds are you know how to pronounce the word. But just for a moment, imagine that you didn't. Sound it out. Go on, I’ll wait.

…

Yeah. Ok so maybe you got it right. But maybe you’re one of many that sounded it out the way I did: Boo-leen. Nowhere in any readings or blog posts or the like did anyone make clear how to say the word. And prior to being corrected, I had turned it into a song to help me study… I have since done a little updating to reflect some newer knowledge (including the proper pronunciation) and, to commemorate reaching the end of my program, I figured I’d share it with you all. Enjoy.
